# List is a collection of heterogenous DT which is ordered and changeable(mutablity). Also allows duplicate members. Dynamic data - List
# Tuples is a collection of heterogenous DT which is ordered and unchangeable(immutable). Also allows duplicate members. Static data - Tuple
# Set is a collection of heterogenous DT which is "unordered" and changeable(mutable). Also does NOT allows duplicate members. They do not follow indexing as they save based on hash mechanism. They are non-subscriptable(indexing)
# set= {1,2,3}  there is no way to create an empty set using ={} becoz thats an empty dict.
# set()

seteg={1,2,3,4,'ankit',4,3,2,1,3,4,5} # <class 'dict'>
