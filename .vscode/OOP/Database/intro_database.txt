if want to store data is called database
file handling will limit the size of the data, if huge then go for database

used for Data storage and data can be : numerical,image, video..etc

there are 3 types of data base

1. Relational database
2. Nosql database
3. NewSql database

Relation DB data is in rows and columns, and data stored here like this
        we use keys foreign keys for mapping one to one

table 1 Names
table 2 details of employee
for this mapping we do use foreign keys
ex: oracle db, redhat, PostgreSQL, MS SQL server

2. No SQL DB    : mostly ised in big data base, 
ex: mongodb, cassandra

3. New SQL:
    higly efficient, its combination of above both
    kind of poms
ex: ArangoDB. mariadb

DB is sql languange

DB knows sql languange
python knows OOPs languange
how they do communicate each other
we need APIS to talk to each other , we called in above is connector.
py connector - understands python and sql

Step 1: Nee to install DB installed ex: PostgreSQL
step 2: need python
step 3: need connector, use the GUI form of connector

how do we find connector:

Django cant share code, it must be self code
