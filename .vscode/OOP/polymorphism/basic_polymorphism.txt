4 Basic concepts of oops are
polymorphism
inheritance
encapsulation
abstraction

Polymorphism:
    Overloading:    constructor, method and operator
    overriding:     constructor, method and operator

Overloading:
    same method and/or different argument types or numbers

ex:

def add(a,b):
    return a+b

def add(a,b,c):
    return a+b+c

Not supported by python, because python interpretor takes latest one def add(a,b,c):    
since it is last and greatest here.
