describes the wrapping of data and method within unit
basically data can be modified within the same class but can not outside the class
similar like private, public an protected
in python   _ no public and protected.
all will be private variables and private methods.

we can not modify the data outside.
usually used inside the os and sys module

double underscore is private 
__a = private variable, with 2 underscore

os_exit(0)      -> private method
